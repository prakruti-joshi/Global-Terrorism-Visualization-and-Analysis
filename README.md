# Global-Terrorism-Visualization-and-Analysis

This project was undertaken as part of the course: Data Interaction Visualisation and Analyis. We have designed and developed an interactive dashboard to explore [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://start.umd.edu/gtd/), which is maintained by the University of Maryland. The database has information regarding ~180K terrorist events around the world for the years 1970-2017 with detailed attributes like number of deaths, damage, terrorist groups invovled, location etc. The dashboard is divided into three main views -

## 1. Trends

## 2. Country Statistics

## 3. Analysis
